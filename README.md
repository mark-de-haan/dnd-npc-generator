# dnd-npc-generator (UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!!)
Hobby project of mine to bring randomized NPC character chards to the internet.

I noticed the lack of NPC generators online and the apps that I found required payments.   
If you are like me than you are probably always pulling half baked NPCs out of your imaginative hat.

I intend to share this app with the internet because DnD is awesome.

## Inspiring apps
I take inspiration from other tools though and have to give credit where credit is due.

- http://www.npcgenerator.com/
- NPCs for Hire on [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.knightsofvasteel.npcforhire&hl=en_US&gl=US) and [Apple app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/npc-for-hire/id1182788017)

# Disclaimer
I do not intend to make a profit with this web application. It is mostly for private use as I am a forever DM.
Running costs on google cloud are only a few cents per month as of writing this.

# Images
All images used in the creation of character cards where either publicly available or were requested through contacting the artists.

If you see your art but would like me to take it down, please contact me via an issue on this github page.
